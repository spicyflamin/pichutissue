                        <p>Wojak, is an Internet meme that is, in its original form, a simple, black-outlined cartoon drawing of a bald man with a wistful expression. The origin of the Wojak illustration is unknown. It may have emerged in 2009 on a Polish imageboard named vichan, from where it was later reposted to the German imageboard krautchan in 2010 by a poster called "wojak."</p>
                        <p>The meme subsequently grew in popularity on 4chan, where the character became associated with the phrases formerly used by wojak such as "I know that feel, bro", "that feel" or "that feel when". Countless variants of the meme have since emerged, expressing different emotions or representing various archetypes.</p>
                        <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>
                        <p>There are 4 main variants of the Wojak, Boomer; coming from the word Baby Boomer. A person born during 1940-1960 is an ignorant old person who ignores what is going on in the world. Zoomer, is a person in Gen- Z from late 2000s to early 2010s who are teeangers-young adults who act cocky and that the world revolves around them. Bloomer, a person who realizes that society is ugly but chooses to see a bright light to things. A growth mindset. Finally a Doomer. Typically people born in the 1990s and early 2000s, typically people who grew up on the internet and finding out that the world is a horrible place and gave up on society. Secluding away from society. 
</p>
                        <p>These characters perfectly describe how much diversity there is in the world. Some are a blommer, some are zoomers, some may be boomers and some can be doomers. 
</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">The Social Dynamic of Society</h2>
                        <p>As funny as it may seem, these pieces of meme culture perfectly describe the ugly truth of the world and many people use these wojaks to prove their political point in society. But what they don't get is that they are describing themselves and how they truly are. Many people identify with the Doomer, questioning love and their place in the world. We are here to follow a myth, die, and be forgotten in the next 100 years. </p>
                        <p>Without achieving anything significant, what truly is the point? The higher-ups created a myth that we all slave our time for: money. Money is just paper and has no true value except that the government makes it seem invaluable. "Money doesn't buy happiness"? Bullshit. Without money, you are just a useless piece of skin, a waste of oxygen. </p>
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">“Money buys everything, except morality and citizens” a quote by Rousseau wrote in 1750, (Vanover, 2024) could be taken as the origin for the very commonly used saying “Money can't buy Happiness”, it explains the limitation money has upon emotional needs.</blockquote>
                        <p>We all slave away for 10+ years of our lives learning things that may or may not be true. Student suicides are at an all-time high while school administrations profit. Neo-Nazis and feminists pressure men to become what they want them to be. </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Most men are perceived to rape, kill, commit massive genocide, and war crimes. People protest against racism, and the whole world seems to be coming to an end. All you can do is watch as your world crumbles apart due to dividing factions. Even if we were all one country, more violence would occur. You repeat the same routine every day with no change.</p>

                        <p>What is the right choice? When will life get better? As people suffer through PTSD and trauma, there is still light out there.</p>
                        <p>These pieces of meme culture represent that our world is divided, and as humans, we are too dumb and stupid to understand the true meaning of why we are here. Maybe one day, when the world falls apart, we will discover the reason we are meant to be here. But that reason is yet to be discovered.</p>
